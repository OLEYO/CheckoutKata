# Checkout Kata

## Description

The Checkout Kata is a coding exercise that simulates the checkout process in a supermarket. In this project, I implement a solution to the Checkout Kata problem using C# and .NET 8.

## Implementation

I have implemented the solution using C# language. The solution consists of the following components:

- `CheckoutKata`: This is the main project containing the implementation of the checkout system.
- `CheckoutKata.Tests`: This project contains unit tests for testing the functionality of the checkout system.

## Usage

To use the checkout system, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the solution file (`CheckoutKata.sln`) in Visual Studio or your preferred IDE.
3. Build the solution to restore dependencies and compile the projects.
4. Run the unit tests in the `CheckoutKata.Tests` project to verify the functionality.
5. You can also integrate the `Checkout` class into your own project and use it for simulating the checkout process in your application.

## Tests

The `CheckoutKata.Tests` project contains several unit tests to validate the functionality of the checkout system. These tests cover various scenarios such as scanning items, calculating total price with special offers, handling invalid items, etc.
